<p><strong>How To Take This Course</strong></p><p>As you go through the course, I highly recommend that you type the code along with me in the videos. This is the best way to learn the material.</p><p>Some students will watch the video first and then replay it while typing in the code. Others like to type along on the first watch. Choose whatever approach works for you.</p><p>But the important thing is that you type in the code. This is the most effective way to really learn the material.</p><p>----</p><p><strong><em>How To Get Help</em></strong></p><p>If you have any coding questions or have a syntax error, here's how you can get help:</p><p><strong>1. Download the source code.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Every coding video has the solution code attached. You can download the solution and compare your code against the solution code.</p><p><strong>2. Post a Message</strong></p><p>If you are not able to resolve the problem, post a message to the discussion forum. Be sure to paste your Java source code along with any relevant config files. </p><p>I'm a very responsive instructor and I'll respond to your question in 24 hours.</p><p>Enjoy the class :-)</p>
