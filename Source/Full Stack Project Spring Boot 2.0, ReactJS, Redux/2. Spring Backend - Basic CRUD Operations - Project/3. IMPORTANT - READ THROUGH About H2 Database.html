<p><strong>Please read through.</strong></p><p>In the next video, we are going to create our object and test whether or not the table gets created in the H2 database. I have received an unexpected number of reports that after opening the H2 database console, the table is not present.</p><p><strong>I want to clarify the following pointers:</strong></p><ol><li><p>I want to remind you, that  <strong>previous basic experience with the Spring Framework is expected for this course</strong>. This was clearly discussed in the <strong>"WATCH BEFORE YOU BUY: Requirements, IDEs, Support"</strong>  video <strong>(Do not skip this video) </strong></p><p>https://www.udemy.com/full-stack-project-spring-boot-20-react-redux/learn/v4/t/lecture/11792132/?instructorPreviewMode=student_v4 </p></li><li><p>You need to make sure that you have <strong>the correct folder structure for your Spring Boot project</strong></p></li><li><p>Check the <strong>Q&amp;A in this lecture</strong>, read through, and <strong>try a different JDBC URL</strong> if the one out of the box doesn't work for you</p></li><li><p>Make sure that you have the right <strong>@Entity import (Please, check your code against mine)</strong></p></li><li><p>Finally, since you have previous experience, <strong>do not get hung up on the H2 database not working</strong> (which should not be the case) <strong>just set up MySQL or any other DB that you are already comfortable with</strong>. Later in the course we will set up MySQL anyway. </p></li></ol><p>Thank you for your attention.</p>
