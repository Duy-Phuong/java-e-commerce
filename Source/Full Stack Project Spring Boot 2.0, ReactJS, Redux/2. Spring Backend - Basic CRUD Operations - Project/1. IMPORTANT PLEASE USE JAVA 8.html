<p>Hi Team:  <code><strong>***No TLDR!!! This is important, make sure you scroll all the way down***</strong></code></p><p>In the next video you will notice that I set my project to work with Java 8. Please make sure that you are using Java 8 in you environment for this project.</p><p><strong>How can I check this?</strong></p><p>In your terminal please run the following command:  java -version</p><p>If you see anything that is <strong>not</strong> Java 8, then you need to set your env to this version.</p><p>In case you need to have several versions of Java in you env, a good option, that I personally use, is sdkman.io, this allows you to install the versions of Java that you need and jump from one to the other when needed.  again: sdkman.io.  You need to read the documentation and install it properly, <strong>please note that supporting this is not in the scope of this course</strong>. Follow the instructions and you should be fine.</p><p><strong><em>Why is that, I mean Java 9 and Java 10 are out? Why not use the latest?</em></strong></p><p>First let me say this, Java 8 is an LTS (Long term support) version of Java, while Java 9 and 10 are actually non-LTS, moreover Oracle is not even supporting them anymore. Java 9 was supported until March 2018 and 10 was supported until September 2018, see for yourselves: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/eol-135779.html. </p><p>It is a common recommendation to always stick to LTS versions of the stack you are using. With java 9 there is a lot that breaks (google it, many complains about this particular version) and too many work arounds required. We are not doing anything that requires features in Java 9 or 10 so please refrain from using those versions for this project.</p><p>Please stick with Java 8 for now. Once the landscape is clearer around Java11 (Released on September 2018) then I will be sure to update you all accordingly. </p><p><strong>Issues running spring-boot 2.0 on Java 9:</strong> https://github.com/<strong>spring-projects</strong>/<strong>spring-boot</strong>/issues/12462 </p><p><br></p>
