<p>Please have the right mindset for this course and for any other software development course that you are taking or planning to take.</p><blockquote><h4><strong>Here is a torpedo of truth:</strong></h4></blockquote><h4><strong>No</strong> six-figure worth, debt-binding university degree, <strong>no</strong> hefty 5-figure worth coding bootcamp, <strong>no</strong> course or book <strong>covers it all</strong>. <strong>No one does</strong>, <strong>no one can! </strong></h4><p><br></p><p>The times I have seen people trying to cover it all then one of two things happen:</p><p>· A good chunk of those topics are covered in a very contrive and virtually useless way just to say “I covered it all”</p><p>· And THE VERY FEW who did covered it all ended up releasing an ENDLESS course or book THAT NO ONE FINISHES ANYWAY!</p><p>No project that I have ever worked on has ever used all of JAVA or all of any tech stack involved. In some projects you use some features, in some you use others. <strong>This course is a project so we will only use and explain the features of the TECH STACK that we need to use in order for us to implement and <em>manually </em>test the functionality that is in scope.</strong></p><p><strong>With that in mind, when you join this course you do so completely aware that anything that is not explicitly covered in this course is out of scope, no exceptions.</strong> If you have recommendations, please let me know. Depending on the topic I might include it in upcoming courses or create a course on the matter.</p><p>Software development courses should be seen as a “<strong>gateway</strong>” for you to grab new skills and also to have a better understanding of how far you want to go. No educational material should ever be seen as “All that you need for a brilliant Software Developer career”. They are all stepping stones for you to build your skills and compete in the job market.</p><p><strong>Please have the right expectations at all times.</strong></p>
