<p>Hi:</p><p>If you have had experience with the basics of the Spring Framework but this is the 1st time you are using Spring Security then I recommend you spend some time understanding the architecture:</p><p>https://spring.io/guides/topicals/spring-security-architecture/ </p><p>Although we will explore each component in depth as we Secure our Spring Boot backend,Â  having read this beforehand will help you have more context of what it is that we are doing.</p><p>There is also a little practical project that will take about 15 minutes and that will give you a nice and easy introduction to the Spring Security world:</p><p>https://spring.io/guides/gs/securing-web/</p><p>Please note that the purpose of this is to get you comfortable with the technology by giving you a little background. Spring Security is not something that can be learned in one shot! It requires practice and the patience to really dig into how it works. </p><p><br></p><p>Thanks!</p>
