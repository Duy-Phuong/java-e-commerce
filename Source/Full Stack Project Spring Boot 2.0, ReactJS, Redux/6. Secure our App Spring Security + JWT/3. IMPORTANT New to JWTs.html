<p>Hi:</p><p>So you have at least basic experience with Spring Security but you have never worked with JWTs before? </p><p>Not a problem! I will walk you through the basic implementation in the videos to come. However, I still recommend that you do some pre-reading so you have some context. Here's a really nice tutorial that I have implemented myself and that really helps you understand JWTs in the context of a Spring Boot app.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Please make sure you <strong>STOP</strong> reading when you see the following header: <strong>"Aside: Securing Spring APIs with Auth0" </strong>as we are <strong>not using Auth0 for this project.</strong></p><p>https://auth0.com/blog/implementing-jwt-authentication-on-spring-boot/ </p><p>Once again, this does not replace the lectures to come! it only helps those with no previous experience to get started with a much simpler use case than the one we are going to implement.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
