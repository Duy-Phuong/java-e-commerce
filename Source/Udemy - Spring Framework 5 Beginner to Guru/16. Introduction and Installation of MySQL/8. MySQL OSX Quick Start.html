<h4><strong>MySQL Editions</strong></h4>

<p>There are several editions for MySQL. Primarily <strong>MySQL Enterprise Edition</strong> and <strong>MySQL Community Edition</strong>.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this course, we will be using the <strong>MySQL Community Edition</strong>.</p>

<p>The MySQL Enterprise Edition is a paid version of MySQL, which comes with support from Oracle. The functionality for writing SQL for the two editions are the same.</p>



<h4><strong>MySQL OSX Installation</strong></h4>

<p>There are several installation options available for OSX.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Native Package Installer</strong> - This is an installation program supported by the MySQL community, and will install MySQL on OSX natively.</li><li><strong>MacPorts</strong> - Is a popular package installer for OSX, which supports the installation of MySQL.</li><li><strong>HomeBrew</strong> - Is also a popular package installer for OSX, which supports the installation of MySQL.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Recommendation </strong>- If you are not familiar with MacPorts or HomeBrew, use the Native Package installer. If you are comfortable using either MacPorts or HomeBrew, feel free to use either of these.</p>

<p><strong>Native Package Installer</strong></p>

<p>Complete instructions for using the Native Package Installer available on MySQL's <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/osx-installation.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website here</a>. You will want to, at minimum, install MySQL Server. Installation of Preference Plane and launchd is recommended. </p>

<p><strong>MacPorts</strong></p>

<p>MacPorts is my personal preference for package installers on OSX. You can find instructions for installing MySQL with <a href="https://trac.macports.org/wiki/howto/MySQL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MacPorts here</a>.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with MacPorts, I recommend you use the Native Package Installer.</p>

<p><strong>HomeBrew</strong></p>

<p>Installation of MySQL with HomeBrew is very straight forward. You can find some notes for using HomeBrew to install <a href="https://gist.github.com/nrollr/3f57fc15ded7dddddcc4e82fe137b58e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MySQL here</a>.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with using HomeBrew, I recommend you use the Native Package Installer. </p>
